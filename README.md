## Problem Statement

Address inadequacies in the system by pushing awareness and giving patients access to basic health and medical information.

## Background

India has a chronic disease burden or non-communicable diseases burden of almost 20% of its population, where nearly 200 million people have some chronic disease. Of that, just diabetes and hypertension afflict some 100 million people, and that patient population is growing by 13% a year. To make matters worse, the rate of patient adherence to prescribed treatments is abysmally low.
