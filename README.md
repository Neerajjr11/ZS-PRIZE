## Problem Statement

Address inadequacies in the system by pushing awareness and giving patients access to basic health and medical information.

## Background

India has a chronic disease burden or non-communicable diseases burden of almost 20% of its population, where nearly 200 million people have some chronic disease. Of that, just diabetes and hypertension afflict some 100 million people, and that patient population is growing by 13% a year. To make matters worse, the rate of patient adherence to prescribed treatments is abysmally low.

* Currently there is dysfunction in healthcare, the cost of medicines outweigh the outcomes of the patients.
* MEDHEAD aims to address the inadequacies in the current healthcare system by providing access to basic health and medical information for patients.

### Report Scanner
* We have also built an automated report scanner using OCR which will remove the need for people to manually enter their records and results.
* Just a simple upload will retrieve all their details.
* This will be very convenient for the user and if something is not captured by the OCR then they can modify accordingly using manual input too.

### Medical Chatbot
* Users can also make use of the AI powered medical chatbot for simple day to day problems and look for reliable solutions.
* This chatbot is more like a conversational way to get answers to your daily problems like you got a cut / fever and you are not aware of what to do and a google search can lead to incorrect answers / to complex answers.
* This will give you the point and accurate answers.
